# ObsidianMiningGame

A Minecraft Datapack PVP game based on gathering Obsidian for points!

The Obidsian Mining Game, or OMG for short, is a survival based game in which players have to obtain and turn in 32 (this amount is configurable) Obsidian blocks.

## Gameplay

When a player has at least 1 block of obsidian in their inventory, they'll be given the glowing effect so every other player within range will be able to see their location. Thus giving them the option to track that player's down and get their obsidian.

Also pressing the player list key (defaults to TAB), players can see exactly how many obsidian each other player has in their inventory.

When a player dies they will keep the contents of their armour slots and hotbar. However, they will always drop obsidian no matter the slot.

All obsidian has been removed from the loot tables of chests.

The Nether is disabled.

### Points
Turn in your obsidian to gain points on the scoreboard. To do this, you'll need to visit the Wandering Obsidian Trader!

### The Wandering Obsidian Trader
The Obsidian Trader will spawn at a random location on the map after 20 minutes (1 Minecraft Day).
Also, every 5 minutes the Trader will move to another random location.
Players will be given a compass that points towards the current location of the trader.

There is collectively a maximum of 8 obsidian that can be traded in for points at any one time. This is not per player, but for all players. This limit refreshes every time the Trader moves (i.e. every 5 mins).

## Rules

There's no PVP allowed for the first 20 minutes, giving all players an equal chance to get started.

After 20 minutes an announcement will be made that PVP is now allowed.
